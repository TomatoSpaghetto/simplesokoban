# SimpleSokoban

A lightweight web-based Sokoban engine. 

`SimpleSokoban` is designed to be easy to understand and play. It runs entirely in your browser.

## How to Play

The goal of Sokoban is to push all the boxes onto the designated target switches.

- **Movement:** Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** to move the character.
- **Pushing:** Move into a box to push it. You can only push one box at a time, and you cannot pull them.
- **Winning:** The level is complete when every switch has a box on top of it.
- **Reset:** If you get stuck (which happens a lot!), use the **Reset** button to restart the level.

## Level Editor

This project includes a built-in Level Editor that allows you to design your own puzzles.

1. **Build:** Use the palette tools to place walls, boxes, and switches.
2. **Download & Import:** When you're happy with your design, use the "Download & Import" button. This will save your levels to a `level.txt` file on your device and let you play them instantly.
3. **Sharing:** To share your levels, just send your `level.txt` file to a friend! They can use the "Choose File" button on the main menu to load and play your creations.
